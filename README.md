 Hi everyone, this project is my school assignment to build a static website with form validation that use javascript.
 
 Tools:
- Xampp
- Visual Studio Code/ your favourite IDE

to set up this system you only need xampp and your favourite IDE in my case it's Visual Studio Code.
clone this project inside the 'C:\xampp\htdocs' folder and then launch it in web browser with 'localhost/foldername'.
